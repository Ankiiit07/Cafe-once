Dietary Restrictions: {{{dietaryRestrictions}}}
Flavor Preferences: {{{flavorPreferences}}}

Consider the available coffee concentrate flavors:
- Original Liquid Coffee Concentrate: The signature, balanced coffee concentrate.
- Vanilla Liquid Coffee Concentrate: Infused with natural vanilla flavor.
- Caramel Liquid Coffee Concentrate: Sweet and rich caramel flavor.
- Mocha Liquid Coffee Concentrate: Chocolate and coffee blend.
- Hazelnut Liquid Coffee Concentrate: Nutty hazelnut flavor.
- Coconut Liquid Coffee Concentrate: Tropical coconut flavor.
- Cinnamon Liquid Coffee Concentrate: Warm cinnamon spice flavor.
- Dark Roast Liquid Coffee Concentrate: Bold and intense coffee.
- Light Roast Liquid Coffee Concentrate: Smooth and bright coffee.
- Decaf Liquid Coffee Concentrate: Rich coffee flavor, decaffeinated.

Based on the users input, recommend one of the available flavors and explain why it is a good fit for them. If none of the flavors fit the dietary restictions, state that none are suitable. If a dietary restriction like "nut allergy" is mentioned, avoid recommending Hazelnut.
